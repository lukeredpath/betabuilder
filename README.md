# BetaBuilder, a gem for managing iOS ad-hoc builds

BetaBuilder is a simple collection of Rake tasks and utilities for managing and publishing Adhoc builds of your iOS apps.

If you're looking for the OSX BetaBuilder app -- to which this gem owes most of the credit -- you can find it [here on Github](http://github.com/HunterHillegas/iOS-BetaBuilder).

**Note: As of release 0.7, support for Xcode 3 is deprecated. Xcode 4 has been out for a year, has got much more stable as of 4.1 on Lion (or 4.2 if you've been using the betas) and it's time to move on. Generating Xcode 4 friendly archives and builds in this release still needs a bit of configuration but will become much smoother in 0.8 once Xcode 3 support is removed.**

## Motivation

The problem with using a GUI app to create the beta packages is that it is yet another manual step in the process of producing an ad-hoc build for your beta testers. It simplifies some steps but it still requires running Build and Archive in Xcode, saving the resulting build as an IPA package, running the Beta Builder app, locating the IPA, filling in the rest of the fields and generating the deployment files. Then you need to upload those files somewhere.

As a Ruby developer, I use Rake in most of my projects to run repetitive, often build or test-related tasks and it's equally as useful for non-Ruby projects as it is for Ruby ones.

This simple task library allows you to configure once and then build, package and distribute your ad-hoc releases with a single command.

## Usage

To get started, if you don't already have a Rakefile in the root of your project, create one. If you aren't familiar with Rake, it might be worth [going over some of the basics](http://rake.rubyforge.org/) but it's fairly straightforward.

You can install the BetaBuilder gem from your terminal (OSX 10.6 ships with a perfectly useful Ruby installation):

    $ gem install betabuilder

At the top of your Rakefile, you'll need to require `rubygems` and the `betabuilder` gem (obviously).

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'betabuilder'

Because BetaBuilder is a Rake task library, you do not need to define any tasks yourself. You simply need to configure BetaBuilder with some basic information about your project and it will generate the tasks for you. A sample configuration might look something like this:

    BetaBuilder::Tasks.new do |config|
      # your Xcode target name
      config.target = "MyGreatApp"

      # the Xcode configuration profile
      config.configuration = "Adhoc"
    end

Now, if you run `rake -T` in Terminal.app in the root of your project, the available tasks will be printed with a brief description of each one:

    rake beta:build     # Build the beta release of the app
    rake beta:package   # Package the beta release as an IPA file

If you use a custom Xcode build directory, rather than the default `${SRCROOT}/build` location, you can configure that too:

    BetaBuilder::Tasks.new do |config|
      ...
      config.build_dir = "/path/to/custom/build/dir"
    end

To deploy your beta to your testers, some additional configuration is needed (see the next section).

Most of the time, you'll not need to run the `beta:build` task directly; it will be run automatically as a dependency of `beta:package`. Upon running this task, your ad-hoc build will be packaged into an IPA file and will be saved in `${PROJECT_ROOT}/pkg/dist`, along with a HTML index file and the manifest file needed for over-the-air installation.

If you are not using the automatic deployment task, you will need to upload the contents of the pkg/dist directory to your server.

To use a namespace other than "beta" for the generated tasks, simply pass in your chosen namespace to BetaBuilder::Tasks.new:

    BetaBuilder::Tasks.new(:my_custom_namespace) do |config|
    end

This lets you set up different sets of BetaBuilder tasks for different configurations in the same Rakefile (e.g. a production and staging build).

## Xcode 4 support

Betabuilder works with Xcode 4, but you may need to tweak your task configuration slightly. The most important change you will need to make is the build directory location, unless you have configured Xcode 4 to use the "build" directory relative to your project, as in Xcode 3.

If you are using the Xcode derived data directory for your builds, then you will need to specify this. Betabuilder will then scan your build log to determine the path to the automatically generated build directory that Xcode is using for your project.

    config.build_dir = :derived

This will become the default in 0.8.

If you wish to generate archives for your Xcode 4 project, you will need to enable this. This will become the default in future once Xcode 3 support is dropped (deprecated in 0.7):

    config.xcode4_archive_mode = true

If you are working with an Xcode 4 workspace instead of a project file, you will need to configure this too:

    config.workspace_path = "MyWorkspace.xcworkspace"
    config.scheme         = "My App Scheme"
    config.app_name       = "MyApp"

If you are using a workspace, then you must specify the scheme. You can still specify the build configuration (e.g. Release).

## Automatic deployment with deployment strategies

BetaBuilder allows you to deploy your built package using it's extensible deployment strategy system; the gem currently comes with support for simple web-based deployment or uploading to [TestFlightApp.com](http://www.testflightapp.com). Eventually, you will be able to write your own custom deployment strategies if neither of these are suitable for your needs.

### Deploying your app with TestFlight

By far the easiest way to get your beta release into the hands of your testers is using the excellent [TestFlight service](http://testflightapp.com/), although at the time of writing it is still in private beta. You can use TestFlight to manage your beta testers and notify them of new releases instantly.

TestFlight provides an upload API and betabuilder uses that to provide a `:testflight` upload strategy. This strategy requires two pieces of information: your TestFlight API token and your team token:

    config.deploy_using(:testflight) do |tf|
      tf.api_token  = "YOUR_API_TOKEN"
      tf.team_token = "YOUR_TEAM_TOKEN"
    end

Now, instead of using the `beta:package` task, you can run the `beta:deploy` task instead. This task will run the package task as a dependency and upload the generated IPA file to TestFlight.

You will be prompted to enter the release notes for the build; TestFlight requires these to inform your testers of what has changed in this build. Alternatively, if you have a way of generating the release notes automatically (for instance, using a CHANGELOG file or a git log command), you can specify a block that will be called at runtime - you can do whatever you want in this block, as long as you return a string which will be used as the release notes, e.g.

    config.deploy_using(:testflight) do |tf|
      ...
      tf.generate_release_notes do
        # return release notes here
      end
    end

Finally, you can also specify an array of distribution lists that you want to allow access to the build:

    config.deploy_using(:testflight) do |tf|
      ...
      tf.distribution_lists = %w{Testers Internal}
    end

### Deploying to HockeyApp

Similar to TestFlight you can also use [HockeyApp](http://hockeyapp.net), you'll need your API token and your App ID.

Example:

    config.deploy_using(:hockeyapp) do |puck|
      puck.api_token = "YOUR_API_TOKEN"
      puck.app_id = "YOUR_APP_ID"
      puck.allow_download = true

      puck.generate_release_notes do
         # return release notes here
      end
    end

### Deploying to your own server

BetaBuilder also comes with a rather rudimentary web-based deployment task that uses SCP, so you will need SSH access to your server and appropriate permissions to use it. This works in the same way as the original iOS-BetaBuilder GUI app by generating a HTML template and manifest file that can be uploaded to a directly on your server. It includes links to install the app automatically on the device or download the IPA file.

You will to configure betabuilder to use the `web` deployment strategy with some additional configuration:

    config.deploy_using(:web) do |web|
      web.deploy_to = "http://beta.myserver.co.uk/myapp"
      web.remote_host = "myserver.com"
      web.remote_directory = "/remote/path/to/deployment/directory"
    end

The `deploy_to` setting specifies the URL that your app will be published to. The `remote_host` setting is the SSH host that will be used to copy the files to your server using SCP. Finally, the `remote_directory` setting is the path to the location to your server that files will be uploaded to. You will need to configure any virtual hosts on your server to make this work.
